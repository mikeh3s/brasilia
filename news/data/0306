They aren&#x2019;t foolproof, but if you have dozens of playlists that need to be moved, they could potentially save you hours.</p><p>First up is <a>Applefy</a>, an application that was originally intended for developers, but has since been reworked for anyone to use. Once you&#x2019;ve <a>downloaded the app from GitHub</a>, follow these instructions from the creator:</p><ul><li>Open the application and log in with your Spotify details.</li><li>Select the playlist you want to transfer from the dropdown list.</li><li>Press the &#x2018;Save Playlist&#x2019; button.</li><li>Navigate to your home folder and there will be a folder called Applefy.</li><li>Inside this folder will be a folder with your playlist name containing MP3s.</li><li>Open iTunes, go to the Playlists tab and make a new playlist.</li><li>Drag the MP3 files into the playlist.</li><li>Select all and right click. Choose &#x2018;Add to iCloud Music Library&#x2019;. wait for the spinner in the top right to finish</li><li>Once the songs have been registered, right click again and &#x2018;Remove download&#x2019;, you can now stream or download the full song using your Apple Music subscription.</li></ul><p>The second method works in a similar fashion, but it&#x2019;ll cost you a few dollars if you want to take advantage of all of its features. Here are the steps you need to take to<a>export your Spotify playlists</a> and convert them <a>with the STAMP app</a>:</p><ul><li>Before you begin, export your Spotify playlists as .csv filed using <a>Exportify</a></li><li>Next, <a>go to the STAMP website</a> and download the app for ~$5.00</li><li>Open iTunes and head to either the For You or the New tab</li><li>Open STAMP and select the .csv file you want to import</li><li>Click parse and wait for the application to finish importing</li></ul><p>From here, you won&#x2019;t actually have the playlists on your Apple Music account, but all the songs will be in your library. The best way to recreate these playlists seems to be the following technique (<a>thanks, GottaBeMobile</a>):</p><p><blockquote><p>&#x201C;[Import] all the playlists you want to Apple Music and then click on My Music. Right click on the columns and add Date Added. Sort by Date Added which goes down to the minute so that you have the songs you added in order. Then highlight the songs you need to add to the new playlist and add them. Repeat for the rest of your Spotify playlists.&#x201D;</p></blockquote></p><p>It&#x2019;s a shame that there&#x2019;s no simple process for moving playlists between services, but these methods will still save you a ton of time.</p><p><b>Related stories</b></p><p><a>How to fix an annoying bug in iOS and OS X that breaks Gmail</a></p><p><a>The 10 best paid iPhone apps on sale for free today</a></p><p><a>iPhone 6s: The 6 most exciting new features hitting Apple&#x2019;s next iPhone</a></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>More from BGR:</b> <a>Game show fail: How to lose a million bucks in 3&#x2026; 2&#x2026; 1&#x2026;</a></p><p><b>This article was <a data-ylk='elm:itm;elmt:link;t1:a2;t2:article;t3:body;t8:d1972d3d-5d17-3641-8926-f6bfb596c402;t9:18;itc:0'>originally published on BGR.com</a></b></p></div><div></div></div>", "docid": "0306_15071107_004", "img": [{"src": "../image/img_0306_4_1.jpg", "alt": "How to Move Your Spotify Playlists to Apple Music", "ref": "<!--IMG#1-->"}], "ptime": "2015-07-10  17:34:20", "title": "How to Move Your Spotify Playlists to Apple Music", "hasHead": 0, "source": "Yahoo Tech", "imgsrc": "../image/cover_0306_4.jpg", "digest": "Now that Apple Music has officially launched, many Spotify users are trying to figure out the best way to export their playlists from one service to the other."}, "0306_15071107_005": {"body": "<div><div><figure><!--IMG#1--></figure><p>I am counting the days to <a>Amazon Prime Day</a>&#xA0;on July 15, when the online shopping giant marks its twentieth anniversary (where did the time go?) with a global, one-day shopping event.

I always find a bargain. And, despite the speed of delivery, I never pay for shipping.</p><p>That <a>Amazon Prime</a> also comes with unlimited streaming of movies, TV shows, music and books as well as unlimited secure photo storage with Prime Photos is&#x2014;for me&#x2014;just gravy.</p><p>In short, I think Amazon Prime is well worth it, even when it&#x2019;s not Prime Day. But I have it from my very reliable source that Prime Day <i>is</i> going to have some amazing bargains. The deals will start at midnight, with new ones posting as often as every ten minutes. There will be thousands of Lightning Deals, and seven Deals of the Day. And they will all come with that fast, free shipping.</p><p>According to my inside source&#x2014;who absolutely refused to divulge any more details than this&#x2014;these sweet deals will include these two tempting tech bargains:</p><p><b>A quality, name-brand 32-inch Smart HDTV for under $200 </b></p><p><b>Chromebook laptops for only $199 &#xA0;</b></p><p>I know where I&#x2019;ll be on the 15th: Right here, pretending to work with my credit card handy.

On the other end, Google has launched a feature called Gmail Postmaster Tools, which provides data that can help email senders better diagnose why certain emails get classified as spam.</p><p>Determining which messages are spam and which are not is a neverending battle, especially since a message considered spam to one person could be legitimate to another. Messages from banks, airlines and other companies fall into this category. How does Google tell if a certain email is a sales promotion or an important notice informing you of information on your bank account or an upcoming flight? Spammers have also gotten smarter, using more tricks to better disguise junk mail so that automated spam filters have a tougher time figuring out how to tag it. So what new tools and techniques is Google using in the fight against spam?</p><p>Gmail&apos;s spam filter is now using an artificial neural network, aka artificial intelligence, to become smarter. When you tag a message as spam or not spam, you help the spam filter learn from its mistakes, so it can be more accurate and reliable in the future. But the new neural network takes that a step further by better detecting and blocking &quot;the especially sneaky spam,&quot; meaning the kind that can easily pass for legitimate mail.</p><p>Further, advances in machine learning now can help the spam filter better learn each individual&apos;s preferences. So it can correctly tag a certain message as spam for you but as legitimate for another user. One example is a weekly email newsletter, which one person may want and another may not. The Gmail spam filter has also gotten smarter at spotting email impersonation, meaning messages that came from a source other than the actual sender. Spammers typically use bogus addresses so they can&apos;t be detected, but a more sophisticated spam filter can identify mail from such addresses.</p><p>Legitimate email senders also have to step in when their messages are inaccurately tagged as spam. And to aid them in this task, Google is offering its new <a>Gmail Postmaster Tools</a>. These tools can help high-volume mail senders analyze spam reports, delivery errors and other factors to determine why their legitimate messages are being falsely identified as junk.</p><p>Somanchi said that less than 0.1 percent of email in the average Gmail inbox is spam, and the amount of legitimate mail stuck in the spam folder is even lower, at under 0.05 percent. But the battle continues.</p><p>&quot;Ultimately, we aspire to a spam-free Gmail experience,&quot; Somanchi said. &quot;So please keep those spam reports coming, and if you&apos;re a company that sends email, then check out our new <a>Postmaster Tools</a>. Together we can get the wanted mail to the right place, and keep the spam where it belongs.&quot;</p></div><div><p><strong></strong><strong>Also from CNET:</strong></p><ul><li><a>10 dog gadgets just as weird as the Woof Washer 360</a></li><li><a>Get 30GB free cloud storage for life</a></li><li><a>Save a wet phone or tablet</a></li></ul><p></p></div></div>", "docid": "0306_15071107_003", "img": [{"src": "../image/img_0306_3_1.jpg", "alt": "How Google tries to keep 'sneaky' spam from your inbox", "ref": "<!--IMG#1-->"}], "ptime": "2015-07-10  18:13:11", "title": "How Google Tries to Keep 'Sneaky' Spam From Your Inbox", "hasHead": 0, "source": "Yahoo Tech", "imgsrc": "../image/cover_0306_3.jpg", "digest": "The search giant is now using savvier machine learning to better tell which messages are legit and which ones are junk."}, "0306_15071107_008": {"body": "<div><div><figure><!--IMG#1--></figure><p>Wearables bring technology closer to our bodies than any other devices in recent memory.
