(AP) — Saying South Carolina's history has forever changed, Gov. Nikki Haley signed a bill Thursday to relegate the Confederate flag to the state's 'relic room,' more than 50 years after the rebel banner began flying at the Statehouse to protest the civil rights movement.</p><p>Compelled to act by the slaughter of nine African-Americans at a church Bible study, Gov. Nikki Haley praised lawmakers for acknowledging that the long-celebrated symbol is too painful and divisive to keep promoting.</p><p>'The Confederate flag is coming off the grounds of the South Carolina Statehouse,' Haley said before signing the bill. 'We will bring it down with dignity and we will make sure it is stored in its rightful place.'</p><p>Police then surrounded the rebel flag with barricades and rope, a siege of sorts that will end Friday after the banner is furled for the last time at a 10 a.m. ceremony.</p><p>South Carolina's leaders first flew the battle flag over the Statehouse dome in 1961 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Civil War. It remained there to represent official opposition to the civil rights movement.</p><p>Mass protests against the flag decades later led to a compromise in 2000 with lawmakers who insisted that it symbolized Southern heritage and states' rights. They agreed then to move it to a 30-foot pole next to a Confederate monument out front.</p><div><a data-type='slideshow'><div><!--IMG#1--> </div></a></div><p>But even from that lower perch, the flag was clearly visible in the center of town, and flag supporters remained a powerful bloc in the state.</p><p>The massacre 22 days ago of state Sen. Clementa Pinckney and eight others inside Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church suddenly changed this dynamic, not only in South Carolina but around the nation.</p><p>Police said the killings were racially motivated. By posing with the Confederate flag before the shootings, suspect Dylann Storm Roof, who has not yet entered a plea to nine counts of murder, showed that the flag also has symbolized white supremacy and racial oppression.</p><p>Haley moved first, calling lawmakers to vote the flag down. Very quickly thereafter, Republican leaders in other states who have long cultivated the votes of Confederate flag supporters announced that Civil War symbols no longer deserve places of honor.</p><p>'These nine pens are going to the families of the Emanuel Nine,' Haley said after signing the bill into law. 'Nine amazing individuals who have forever changed South Carolina history.'</p><div><a data-pos='2'><div><!--IMG#2--> </div></a></div><p>The governor said the way the victims welcomed the gunman into their Bible study, and the forgiveness survivors expressed when the suspect later appeared in court, have inspired change nationwide.</p><p>'Nine people took in someone who did not look like them or act like them. And with true love and true faith and acceptance, they sat and prayed with him for an hour. That love and faith was so strong that it brought grace to them and the families,' Haley said.</p><p>'We saw the families show the world what true grace and forgiveness look like,' she added. 'That set off an action of compassion by people in South Carolina and all over this country. They stopped looking at their differences and started looking at their similarities.'</p><p>The flag removal bill passed easily in the Senate, where the Rev. Pinckney served, but then stalled as House members proposed dozens of amendments. Any changes could have delayed the flag's removal and blunted momentum for change.</p><p>The debate stretched on for more than 13 hours as representatives shared anger, tears and memories of their ancestors. Flag supporters talked about grandparents passing down family treasures. Some lamented that the flag had been 'hijacked' or 'abducted' by racists.</p><div><a data-pos='3'><div><!--IMG#3--> </div></a></div><p>Rep. Mike Pitts recalled playing with a Confederate ancestor's cavalry sword while growing up, and said the flag reminds him of dirt-poor Southern farmers who fought Yankees, not because they hated blacks, but because their land was being invaded.</p><p>Black Democrats, frustrated at being asked to honor those who fought for slavery, offered their own family histories.</p><p>Rep. Joe Neal traces his ancestry to four brothers, brought to America in chains and bought by a slave owner named Neal who pulled them apart from their families.</p><p>'The whole world is asking, is South Carolina really going to change, or will it hold to an ugly tradition of prejudice and discrimination and hide behind heritage as an excuse for it?' Neal said.</p><p>Rep. Jenny Horne, a white Republican who said she is a descendant of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, scolded her party members for stalling.</p><div><a data-pos='4'><div><!--IMG#4--> </div></a></div><p>'I cannot believe that we do not have the heart in this body to do something meaningful such as take a symbol of hate off these grounds on Friday,' she shouted. 'For the widow of Sen. Pinckney and his two young daughters, that would be adding insult to injury and I will not be a part of it!'</p><p>The bill ultimately passed by a 93-27 vote — well above the two-thirds supermajority needed to make changes to the state's 'heritage' symbols.</p><p>Republican Rep. Rick Quinn said he was satisfied after lawmakers promised to find money — perhaps millions of dollars —for a special display in the state's Confederate Relic Room for the flag being removed, as well as the one taken down from the dome in 2000.</p><p>'It's just like the conclusion of the war itself,' Pitts said Thursday afternoon after the vote. 'The issue was settled, and the nation came back together to move on.'</p><p>But Republican Rep. Jonathon Hill, who voted against removing the flag, said he fears a larger movement has begun to eliminate Civil War-era history.</p><p>'Hopefully it ends here, and we move forward, and we can put all of this behind us,' Hill said.</p><p>Some groups are already seeking to do just that. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People will consider ending its 15-year boycott of South Carolina's economy at its national convention this weekend. The NCAA, which honored that ban, said it will resume holding championship events in the state.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP and Meg Kinnard at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .</p><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>", "docid": "0301_15071107_005", "img": [{"src": "../image/img_0301_5_1.jpg", "alt": "Confederate flag protest in South Carolina", "ref": "<!--IMG#1-->"}, {"src": "../image/img_0301_5_2.jpg", "alt": "South Carolina Gov.

(Photo:&#xA0;Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</i></p><p> Katherine Archuleta, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, has resigned from her post amid a cascading scandal over her handling of a massive breach of federal employee data. </p><p> Archuleta, who has been at the helm of OPM since November 2013, submitted her resignation Friday morning. </p><p> OPM announced Thursday that the size of a hack that began last year led to the pilfering of sensitive personal information of 21.5 million former and current employees. That admission, following weeks of scrutiny on Capitol Hill after OPM acknowledge a separate data breach that affected 4.2 million, led to a rush of lawmakers who called for her ousting, including the top three House Republicans and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee. </p><p> Beth Cobert, the deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget, will take over Archuleta&#x2019;s job, OMB said. </p><p> &#x201C;Today I informed the OPM workforce that I am stepping down as the leader of this remarkable agency and the remarkable people who work for it,&#x201D; Archuleta said in a statement. &#x201C;This morning, I offered, and the President accepted, my resignation as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. I conveyed to the President that I believe it is best for me to step aside and allow new leadership to step in, enabling the agency to move beyond the current challenges and allowing the employees at OPM to continue their important work.&#x201D; </p><p> The data breach compromised 19.7 million individuals&#x2019; Social Security numbers, and the remainder of the affected individuals&#x2014;1.8 million people&#x2014;were family and friends. In addition to Social Security numbers, the stolen information included employment history, financial and health history, addresses, and even fingerprints. The hack announced Thursday occurred at roughly the same time as another hack, which OPM announced in June. That data breach affected 4.2 million current and former federal workers, 3.6 million of whom were also affected by the larger breach. </p><p> Archuleta had remained resolute in the face of withering scrutiny, and the White House had expressed support for her as recently as Thursday. When asked on a press call if she would step down, Archuleta said &#x201C;no&#x201D; and credited her agency with improving its cybersecurity since she had taken over. </p><p> &#x201C;It is because the efforts of OPM and its staff that we&#x2019;ve been able to identify the breaches,&#x201D; Archuleta said. </p><p> Archuleta served as a national political director for President Obama&#x2019;s reelection campaign. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a GOP candidate for the White House, had taken to referring to her as a &#x201C;political hack&#x201D; who needed to be removed. </p><p> Warner, who represents thousands of federal workers who live in Northern Virginia, said Friday, &#x201C;This is the right move for the agency and all those affected by the breach.&#x201D; </p><p> Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Archuleta&#x2019;s removal was the &#x201C;right decision, and one that will help to restore confidence in an agency that not only poorly defended sensitive data of millions of Americans but struggled to respond to repeated intrusions.&#x201D; </p></div><div><p> &#x201C;This change in leadership is also an acknowledgement that we cannot simply place blame on the hackers, but need to take responsibility for the protection of personal information that is so obvious a target,&#x201D; Schiff added. </p><p> OPM said Thursday it would notify the 21.5 million individuals affected by the larger hack, and offer them at least three years of comprehensive credit monitoring and fraud protection services at no cost. But the agency <a> does not yet have a contractor </a> in place to provide the services. <br /></p><p><b>More from National Journal:</b></p><ul><li><a>How views like Trump&#x2019;s become socially taboo</a><br /></li><li><a>Rick Santorum wants to be more than a pro-life candidate</a><br /></li><li><a>Flag fight leaves a divided house</a><br /></li></ul></div></div>", "docid": "0301_15071107_003", "img": [{"src": "../image/img_0301_3_1.jpg", "alt": "OPM Director Katherine Archuleta resigns in wake of massive data breach", "ref": "<!--IMG#1-->"}], "ptime": "2015-07-10  13:02:22", "title": "U.S. personnel chief quits after massive data breach", "hasHead": 0, "source": "Yahoo News", "imgsrc": "../image/cover_0301_3.jpg", "digest": "Katherine Archuleta, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, has resigned from her post amid a cascading scandal over her handling of a massive breach of federal employee data, a congressional source has told National Journal."}, "0301_15071107_002": {"body": "<div><div><figure><!--IMG#1--></figure><p><i>This is a forgery.

We&#x2019;ve referred the matter to the FBI and CIA,&#x201D; Durbin spokesman Ben Marter said in a statement. CIA spokeswoman Lyssa Asbill said the agency was &#x201C;aware of the fake letter&#x201D; but declined to detail what kind of follow-up would come from the agency. </p><p> Marter highlighted the message&#x2019;s wobbly English, but it is also laughably detailed and preposterously contends that the U.S. Senate dictates specific Cabinet appointments and who gets top corporate jobs in Ukraine. </p><p> &#x201C;I concur, it is necessary to invest every effort to keep Oleksiy Pavlenko in his office of Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food.

In February 2014, someone leaked the audio of <a> an intercepted telephone call between Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland and Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt </a> in which they discussed American preferences on who should be &#x2014; and should not be &#x2014; in Ukraine&#x2019;s government. </p><p> But laying such activity at the doorstep of the Senate, even at the feet of Durbin, <a> one of its fiercest Russia critics </a> , wildly exaggerates the sway lawmakers have over policy. </p><p> The letter wasn&#x2019;t the first in the propaganda wars over Ukraine.
