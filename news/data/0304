A co-founder of BlackRock (<a>BLK</a>), the largest asset manager in the world, Schlosstein today runs the independent investment advisory firm, Evercore (<a>EVR</a>).</p><p>But Schlosstein also knows Washington pretty well, having worked there from 1974 to 1981, initially as Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Department and later as Associate Director of the White House Domestic Policy Staff, advising President Carter on urban policy and economic development. His wife, Ambassador Jane Hartley, is also a former Carter administration official and was a top campaign fundraiser who reportedly raised $500,000 for Obama in 2012. She was tapped as the United States’ top envoy to France and Monaco last year.</p><p>Schlosstein, the self-made man who knows business and politics so well, thinks Washington needs fixing. In the attached interview with Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief, Andy Serwer, Schlosstein says a lot has changed since his time in Washington. “While there were certainly partisan politics at that time, on most issues there was a solid core of the Democratic party and the Republican party-- both sides-- who would generally vote to do the right thing for the country,” he says. “And if a president called up, it didn’t matter which party he was, if he was calling a senator or a congressman of the opposite party and he said, 'This is really important for the country,' they generally got the vote,” according to Schlosstein. That isn’t the case anymore, he says.</p><p><a><strong>To watch the full interview with Schlosstein, click here.</strong></a></p><p><a></a></p><p>Schlosstein—who says he has no plans to get into politics-- thinks the divisiveness on Capitol Hill stems from the primary process where candidates are always eyeing that next election. “Unfortunately, we have a process where the extremes of the parties dominate… It’s so much harder to get a central consensus,” he says. Schlossteins says it will take “a very strong and respectful leader to break that down.”</p><p>So what does Schlosstein think of the race shaping up for the 2016 presidential election? With a crowded Republican field, he says it’s going to take a little while for the GOP to sort itself out. “There is no one who you would say is odds-on favorite or even 2 to 1. But I think the lowest odds horse in this year’s Kentucky Derby was about 3 to 1. I would probably put [Jeb] Bush around there.”</p><p><strong><a>Get the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance App</a></strong></p><p>The reason why? In a word, money. “Not necessarily because of his view on this or that because his views in some respects are not necessarily right up the center of the fairway of the Republican primary voter. They are much more up the center of the fairway of the national election voter,” he says. But Bush will likely have an edge because he has an overwhelming lead in fundraising. According to Schlosstein, a Bush campaign insider says that Jeb Bush has as much if not more in his war chest as all the other GOP candidates combined.</p><p>On the Democratic side, Schlosstein says it’s almost impossible not to see Hillary Clinton as the party’s presidential nominee. Whether or not Clinton has Schlosstein’s support is another question. When asked, Schlosstein points out he has supported Republicans on the city level: Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg each time he ran, and Rudy Giuliani in one mayoral election.</p><p>“I have never found a Republican at the national level that I prefer to the Democratic candidate,” he says. “But it’s always possible.”</p><p><strong>More from Yahoo Finance</strong></p><p><a><strong>Here’s where all the presidential candidates get their campaign money</strong></a></p><p><a><strong>These countries work harder than the U.S.</strong></a></p><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>", "docid": "0304_15071107_003", "img": [{"src": "../image/img_0304_3_0.png", "alt": "", "ref": "<!--IMG#0-->"}], "ptime": "2015-07-10  11:18:42", "title": "BlackRock co-founder: Bush has more $ than all GOP competitors combined", "hasHead": 0, "source": "Yahoo News", "imgsrc": "../image/cover_0304_3.jpg", "digest": "Ralph Schlosstein a co-founder of BlackRock, on what it will take to fix Washington."}, "0304_15071107_001": {"body": "<div itemscope='itemscope'><!--IMG#0--><!-- google_ad_section_start --><meta itemprop='datePublished' content='2015-07-10T20:55:59Z' /><meta itemprop='headline' content='US stocks rise on optimism that Greek debt deal will be done' /><meta itemprop='alternativeHeadline' content='' /><meta itemprop='image' content='http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/b7856f27bfc0cd1e7b0f6a706700c002.jpg' /><p>NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks logged their best day in two months Friday as Greece appeared to move closer to securing a bailout deal that will enable it to avoid bankruptcy and keep the country in the euro.</p><p>Greece and its creditors appeared to be narrowing their differences after Athens offered reform proposals in order to secure a third bailout of around 53 billion euros ($59.5 billion). A final decision could be made on Sunday.</p><p>A second day of gains for Chinese stocks also encouraged investors. U.S. stocks had fallen sharply on Wednesday, in part on concern that a monthlong slump in China&#39;s stock market could crimp growth in the world&#39;s second-largest economy.</p><p>&quot;This is a giant collective exhaling,&quot; said Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors.

While that would be the first contraction in earnings in almost six years, the figures are distorted by a big drop in energy company earnings following the collapse in the oil price last year.</p><p>In bond trading, prices fell.

The dollar rose 0.7 percent against the Japanese currency, to 122.80 yen.</p><p>The price of oil declined slightly and ended the week down 7 percent on concerns about economic growth in Europe and China as well as robust production from U.S. drillers. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 4 cents to close at $52.74 a barrel in New York. It ended last week at $56.93 a barrel.

Moreover, after years of bloat and unfathomable waste in the Pentagon, the White House and military officials are beginning to deliver on the more nimble and better focused military that President Obama spoke of on Monday after being briefed on the status of the U.S.-allied war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.</p><p><a><b>Related: </b><b>Defense Budget Fight: Obama Won’t Back Down on Veto Threat </b></a><b> </b> </p><p>Yet the plan to slash the Army’s current military force of 490,000 by 40,000 active duty soldiers, or nine percent, while reducing the number of brigade combat teams from roughly 42 to 35 are viewed as harrowing to many. The military is also concerned that there could be additional cuts of 30,000 or more soldiers in the coming years unless Congress decides to lift spending caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act, according to some experts.</p><p>During a time of economic uncertainty, even as the national unemployment average dipped to 5.3 percent last month, the announced Army personnel cuts will be felt hardest in the South, with its major concentration of military and naval bases, parts of the Midwest and Southwest, and Alaska. In many of these places, Army installations are the driving engine of the local economies.</p><p>“Where you have military installations – typically larger bases – you have towns that grow up around them over the years or decades,” Dakota Wood, a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation said in an interview on Thursday. “And it’s the service members and their families who make up a huge chunk of the economic activity of whatever that town is.”</p><p>That means that car dealerships, barbershops, grocery stores, movie theaters, dry cleaners and a plethora of other businesses all depend on military family’s salaries to make ends meet.

Johnny Isakson (R-GA) told Reuters that he learned from McHugh that the Army intended to cut 4,350 soldiers in Georgia including 950 at Fort Stewart and 3,400 at Fort Benning – cuts that would take place by the end of 2017. </p><p><a><b>Related: </b><b>Pentagon’s $90 Billion ‘Slush Fund’ Comes Under Attack  </b></a><b> </b> </p><p>'I am demanding answers from the Department of Defense on how they are justifying these troop cuts in Georgia,' Isakson said in a statement.

The package would be far larger than the 7.2 billion euros creditors had been offering to Greece during the previous five months of fruitless negotiations.</p> <p>Greece's latest proposal was sent to rescue creditors who will meet this weekend to decide whether to approve them. The new package of loans would be Greece's third bailout program since it lost access to financing from bond markets in 2010.</p> <p>In an unusual move, Tsipras is first seeking authorization from parliament to negotiate with the creditors based on the proposal in a vote Friday. He is essentially asking his Syriza party to sign off on measures that to many feel like a U-turn since more than 60 percent of voters opposed more austerity in last Sunday's referendum.</p> <p>Tsipras convened his party's lawmakers for closed-door discussions Friday morning before the parliamentary debate. The proposal was being debated at committee level Friday afternoon, and it was unclear when the full assembly debate would start. Votes are usually held at midnight, but they can go later.</p> <p>The coalition government has 162 seats in the 300-member parliament and pledged backing on a deal from a large section of opposition lawmakers. But failure to deliver votes from his own government could topple Tsipras' coalition.</p> <p>The proposals are to be discussed by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday, ahead of a summit of the European Union's 28 leaders Sunday.</p> <p>Though German officials would not be drawn on the merits of the Greek proposals, French President Francois Hollande said they are 'serious and credible.' France's Socialist government has been among Greece's few allies in the eurozone during the past months of tough negotiations.</p> <p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs eurozone finance ministers' meetings, said the proposals were 'extensive' but would not say whether he considered them sufficient.</p> <p>On Friday, Dijsselbloem will hold a conference call with the leaders of other key creditors, the EU's executive Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>They are then expected to send their assessment of the proposal to the eurozone finance ministers later Friday.</p> <p>As the government inched closer to a deal to ensure Greece doesn't crash out of Europe's joint currency, some Greeks were furious at the deep spending cuts in the proposals.</p> <p>'If this is Europe, then we don't want this Europe,' said Aristidis Dimoupulos, a marketing professor in Athens. 'If this is the eurozone, we don't care if we go out or in. If in this life we'll be slaves, it's better to be dead.'</p><div><a data-pos='1'><div><!--IMG#1--> </div></a></div> <p>Others adopted a 'wait and see' approach.</p> <p>'I don't know. The chances are fifty-fifty' for a deal, said Athens resident Omiros Fotiadis.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Greece, banks remained shut since the start of last week and cash withdrawals were restricted to 60 euros ($67) per day. Although credit and debit cards work freely within the country, many businesses are refusing to accept them and insisting on cash-only payments. All money transfers abroad, including bill payments, require special permission.</p> <p>Alternate Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas said the banks would be gradually restored to operation. They are currently due to remain closed through Monday, at which time he said a new order would be issued expanding what transactions can be carried out. Experts say it is unlikely that, even in the event of a deal, the limits on cash withdrawals and transfers will be lifted completely for some time.</p> <p>Rallies backing and opposing the government were planned in central Athens for Friday evening.</p> <p>Syriza had resisted a new loans-for-austerity deal, arguing the country is too weak to endure it, with a quarter of the labor force out of work and a growing number living in poverty. But it was forced to resume talks with the creditors as the Greek banks faced the prospect of collapse within days if the country did not receive a new rescue package.</p> <p>Athens finally issued its proposals late Thursday.</p> <p>In return for the new package, the government said it would seek debt relief — a notion gaining ground internationally despite reluctance in Germany.</p> <p>'The realistic proposal from Greece will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Only then will we have a win-win situation,' European Council President Donald Tusk said.</p> <p>On Thursday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also said the possibility of some kind of debt relief would be discussed over coming days.</p> <p>But in a note of caution, he added: 'The room for maneuver through debt re-profiling or restructuring is very small.'</p> <p>___</p> <p>Anna Psaroudakis in Athens, Angela Charlton in Paris and Mike Corder in the The Hague, Netherlands, contributed to this report.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Follow Derek Gatopoulos at http://www.twitter.com/dgatopoulos and Elena Becatoros at http://www.twitter.com/ElenaBec</p> <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>", "docid": "0304_15071107_009", "img": [{"src": "../image/img_0304_9_1.jpg", "alt": "Greece's Tsipras to sell austerity deal to reluctant&nbsp;&hellip;", "ref": "<!--IMG#1-->"}, {"src": "../image/img_0304_9_0.png", "alt": "", "ref": "<!--IMG#0-->"}], "ptime": "2015-07-10  11:04:42", "title": "Greece's Tsipras to sell austerity deal to reluctant party", "hasHead": 0, "source": "Yahoo News", "imgsrc": "../image/cover_0304_9.jpg", "digest": "Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras sought his left-wing party&#039;s backing on Friday for a new budget austerity package that is harsher than what he urged Greeks to reject in a vote just last week, but would ..."}}
